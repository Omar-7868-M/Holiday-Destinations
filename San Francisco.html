    <h3>Alcatraz</h3>
      <p1>
        Alcatraz said to be one of the most haunted places in america and the most haunted prison in the country. Some of the worst people have been to this prison such as Al Capone, George "Machine Gun" Kelly and many more but what makes this prison so intresting is the three prisonsers that escaped the Escape proof prison in 1962 there name:  Frank Morris and John Anglin and Clarence Anglin using spoons to break through the prison walls authorities to this day still don't know if they made it back to San Francisco bay.</br>
        Today Alcatraz acts as a tourist attraction and has over 1 million people visitng the prison anually. The prison now hosts touring events for tourists vist the prison and see what its like one of the most popular cells 14D many prisoners claimed there was something in there with them. one man was heard by guard screeming saying "there is something in here with me" the next day guards found the man strangled to death in the cell. Even Al Capone started to lose his mind whilst in the prison. There are two tours the day time tours and the Night time for the best experience go for the night time tour as thats when visitors have said they got a weird cold feeling.</p1>
